Hi! ðŸ‘‹

#### Keeping Everything Up to Date

There were a couple of things that I've considered while thinking of a solution.

##### Data Storage

First, constantly getting and parsing the data from the World Bank is not a feasible solution, mainly because it takes time. Therefore, I keep the data in a database in a format that is suitable for our application & update it periodically (=once a day by default).

##### Data Versioning

Second, users should not be affected by updates, meaning that they should be able to continue using the application while the data is being updated. Therefore, I keep multiple dataset versions.

##### Avoiding Unnecessary Updates

Third, I want to avoid unnecessary updates. To achieve this, I store an MD5 for each version & only perform an update if an MD5 has changed.

*There is probably an easier way, but* ðŸ¤·.

#### RESTful API Design

##### Search

To build a search with autocomplete suggestions, we need to get a list of countries with `name` and `code` fields. Since there are less than 200 countries & we only need a couple of fields at this stage, it's better to get all countries at once.

**Request:**
```
GET /countries&compact=true
```

**Response:**
```
countries: [{
    name: String,
    code: String
}]
```

#### Visualization

To show a visualization for selected countries, we need to get a list of countries with `name`, `code`, `region`, `incomeGroup`, and `emissions` fields.

**Request:**
```
GET /countries&compact=false&codes=<code1,code2,...,codeN>
```

**Response:**
```
[{
  name: String,
  code: String,
  region: String,
  incomeGroup: String,
  emissions: [{
    year: Number,
    value: Number,
    valuePerCapita: Number
  }]
}]
```

#### Lifetime

To visualize how the situation has changed during the user's lifetime, we need to filter countries by location.

**Request:**
```
GET /countries&compact=false&codes=<code>
```

**Response:**
```
[{
  name: String,
  code: String,
  region: String,
  incomeGroup: String,
  emissions: [{
    year: Number,
    value: Number,
    valuePerCapita: Number
  }]
}]
```

As a result, I've ended up with just one method `GET /countries` that accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter  | Required   | Description                                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compact`  | No         | If set to `true`, only `name` and `code` fields are returned.                |
| `codes`    | No         | If set, only countries with these three-letter country codes are returned.   |
| `from`     | No         | If set, only values where `year > from` are returned.                        |
| `to`       | No         | If set, only values where `year < to` are returned.                          |

*I was also considering returning a version of a dataset and then sending it as a parameter, so that the same version is used throughout the session:*

**_Response:_**
```
{
  version: ObjectId,
  countries: [{
    name: String,
    code: String,
  }]
}
```

**_Request:_**
```
GET /countries&version=<version>
```

*However, I decided not to overcomplicate things.*
